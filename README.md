Pen Wiggler 💃✒️
================

It's the worst drawing robot! Or perhaps the best, if simplicity is your favorite vice.

Work in progress...
Tutorial coming up soon.

- Runs on a Raspberry Pi (2 or 3)
- Draws with a felt tip pen, or maybe other things!
- Uses a Huion H610 or similar drawing tablet for feedback
- Coil emulates a tablet pen (with hardware PWM)
- Three vibration motors wiggle the pen (with software PWM)
